## Day 3

Today I Continued My React Course and Learned how 2 pass Functions in props to other components and also learned how 2 use React First of all

## Day 4

Today I learned about Java more like how 2 create some GUI using Java and also continued with my React Journey but I will be reducing the time which I was giving to it before because from now I will be giving more time to Java and Python(Side Projects).

## Day 5

Today I started Game Developement in which I created a Basic Game which look like 3D Game but is meant for playing like 2D Game. Hope I will make it as soon as possible.

## Day 6

Today got nothing to explain in Detail but I continued my Game Developement Journey.

## Day 7

Today also I continued my Game Developement Journey and also I coded a bit on [Hackerrank](https://hackerrank.com)
