## Day 1

Today I Updated My E-Commerce Website in which I added a Method for Deleting the Product using JavaScript and the Whole Project is made with Python Django named [RushX](https://rushx.pythonanywhere.com).

## Day 2

Today I Updated My Portfolio Website which was already Built with Flask ( A Framework in Python ) to Django ( The Most Advanced FrameWork in Python ) this can be found here [Aman Ojha](https://amanojha.pythonanywhere.com)

## Day 3

Today I Continued My React Course and Learned how 2 pass Functions in props to other components and also learned how 2 use React First of all

## Day 4

Today I learned about Java more like how 2 create some GUI using Java and also continued with my React Journey but I will be reducing the time which I was giving to it before because from now I will be giving more time to Java and Python(Side Projects).

## Day 5

Today I started Game Development in which I created a Basic Game that looks like a 3D Game but is meant for playing like a 2D Game. Hope I will make it as soon as possible.

## Day 6

Today got nothing to explain in Detail but I continued my Game Development Journey.

## Day 7

Today also I continued my Game Development Journey and also I coded a bit on [Hackerrank](https://hackerrank.com)

## Day 8

Added Custom 404 and 500 Error Page to be served when a user entered the URL on the Address Bar, which includes Designing and adding it to my Django Portfolio wanna Try hit this URL [Go to the Custom Error Page](https://amanojha.pythonanywhere.com/testing-this-url-for-the-viewers-satisifaction)

## Day 9

Continued my Java Course for the College Course which I am ahead of 2 Units.

## Day 10

Worked on My 3D Game and made a bit of change while creating a new project which will be a complete 3D Game also made some models which I will use in my Game which I call Cube Runner.

## Day 11

I did complete My Android App on which I was trying to get over for a long time. Also, I completed my Core Java Course by Naveen Reddy a.k.a. Telusko.

## Day 12

Today I started to attend a Blog Writing Online assessment program in which I will be taught how to write perfect blogs depending upon the topics from deciding the Blog topics to publishing them online.

## Day 13

Today I made a progress in my Blog writing. Today I learned how to find a trendy topic for my Niche ( The specific area in which you want to write blog posts is called Niche ). You can have researched your Niche by using tools like **alltop** and **Google Trends**.

## Day 14

After you had decided on the trend on which you want to write blog posts for some time shortly now it is important to create some catchy headlines for your blog post you can have some catchy headlines using these websites for free **TheHoth** and **Hub Spot**.

## Day 15

Now when you are ready with your Catchy Headlines for the blog post let's analyze the headline for the amount of traffic it can gain with that headline. You can use **Coschedule** for this purpose.

## Day 16

After you have written your blog post I'm sure it will be the best of your content but let's improve it a bit more. You can use **Power Thesaurus** and **Dictionary.com** to Improvise your words to make a better impact on your readers.

## Day 17

After making the necessary changes in the words of the blog we must evaluate our blog with some grammar check tool. You can use the **Grammarly** tool to get your grammar check for free with additional suggestions.

## Day 18

Adding Images and gif format videos in your blog post always preferable to make your content more attractive to the reader or the users of the platform either it is your blogging website or some free blogging platforms. You can use **Blogger** for this.

## Day 19

Creating your image or gif format videos is best as you don't have to search for the image or gif format videos. You can use **Giphy GIF maker** or **ImgFlip**. And for Editing Images you can use **Canva** and **Pixlr**.

## Day 20

Check your plagiarism to check the availability of the content over the internet so that your content doesn't match up with some other blogs over the internet because it can lead you to get sued for stealing their content. You can use **Dupli Checker** or **Quetext** to get your job done for free.

## Day 21

From today I started building a Mini Project for my Best friend [Apoorva](https://instagram.com/apoorva_vats20) which will be a website similar to [Udemy](https://udemy.com) where everyone will be having access to the best books and best video courses over the Internet.

## Day 22

I started designing for a website that can be used for the best UI for the users ( and I think I had my best-Designing skills in this ).

## Day 23

I made a bit of Home Page and the Course pages which will help me out to create the HTML contents via Jinja Templating ( Django related terminology ). It looks good but yes the Dashboard page looks awful to the eyes.

## Day 24

I made a bit of the model and Database Designing and Table separation from other entries or you can say like the creation of tables in Database [ new table for the new task ].

## Day 25

Worked on views like how the URLs will work and how the data will be presented to the user once the user hits the website with its Unique IP address.

## Day 26

Created some session variables in Python for the website and allotted the users a special user name which will be compared for every particular task and operations will be performed based on the user name which will be stored in a session variable.

## Day 27

Worked on some of the images and URLs of the books which shall be provided to the user once the user had done with purchasing ( btw I had not made the process for purchasing but working on the file how the user can access the file once logged in ).

## Day 28

After they can be downloaded I thought of to get rid of the Payment system in this website and now working on it not like I made in [RushX](https://rushx.pythonanywhere.com) but still a decent payment system where you can get the payment done after the owner confirms that you had made the payment yea it is old school but still I love it [ sometimes you can cheat with your customers I know that's illegal but I still dream of this ]

## Day 29

Done with the Payment system and now also with the user based view where a user can have some setting according to the user settings ( Wanna try this website ?? DM me on my [Instagram](https://instagram.com/aman_.1107))

## Day 30

Fixed some bugs in this website like the user image was not loading and the password was not secure when it was going in the Database. Finally Done with the Mini Project of my friend I can still make it good than its current position but I have to build my Project also which I am thinking to make a Youtube clone with a Hotstar look or GUI Tell me on my [Instgram](https://instagram.com/aman_.1107)

## Day 31

Handed over the Project to [Apoorva](https://instagram.com/apoorva_vats20) and now waiting for the Responses for my project is it Good or not till now I have got 8 response from your side I was expecting at least 20 but not bad I will try to decide on that only BTW I will be still waiting for you all till then I will go back to [Hackerrank](https://hackerrank.com) 

## Day 32

So today I got 10 Responses from your side and I will do the necessary modifications and continue to the same Project I was telling you all about also I will keep on updating this website and this will be 100% free of cost so you don't have to pay in this website to watch contents just like [YouTube](https://youtube.com), not like [Hotstar](https://hotstar.com) but today also back to the [Hackerrank](https://hackerrank.com).

## Day 33 

I started designing my Website with HTML and CSS but trying to not make an exact copy of [Hotstar](https://hotstar.com) for I don't know for legal reasons and also I am seeking some inspirations for this on dribble if you got some please let me know.

## Day 34

I had Developed a Prototype for my website which can be seen on my [Instagram](https://instagram.com/aman_.1107) I used Figma for this design and hope to design more ( just saying but designing is not my cup of tea I got to know now ).

## Day 35

I now have Developed some of the Data modules for the Database and tables for the website I am going to Develop. It is the easiest thing I think at my level coz all you have to do is figuring out which things are going where and you are done with it But sometimes it feels frustrating when you have to enable the comments.

## Day 36

Today I started Writing HTML for this with mostly CSS to make the best UI for the user. and with some basic competitive coding thing.

## Day 37

Designing is almost complete but it will consume me today's day most probably tomorrow it will be complete because still I have some pages ( with CSS ).

## Day 38

Developed some models in Python for constructing the Database Tables while integrating the Firebase with Django ( which I will be using as a backend for this Project ) 

## Day 39

Today I created the views for the users which they get when they hit my website also worked on data models that what content will be available to them when they log in or open the website.

## Day 40

Developed logics for the user signup and user log in with the connection variables for the user to set up the settings based on their preference such as dark mode and other stuff.

## Day 41

Today I developed the login for the user to change the password as well as the username and reducing the space required to a fixed storage ( trying to figure out ).

## Day 42

I figured out how to reduce the storage to almost fixed things. Let me tell you how to do this
What if I just tell the user to store the image or the video to some of your hosting platforms or Google storage and provide us the link then through that link we will access the item it can be image or video just to place it under the correct tag in HTML5 and everything will work just as fine so trying out how to implement it.

## Day 43

So this technique worked just as I thought and it provides me to get some free images to the articles or the content and paste the URL to the Adress bar which Django provides and deliver the content to the consumer of the website and now trying out the same thing with the video.

## Day 44

Finally finished with this project and fixed some bugs like images not being rendered when data models were differentiated for anime and movies.
