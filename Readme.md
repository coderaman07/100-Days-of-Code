## Day 11

I did completed My Android App on which I was trying to get over since long time. Also I completed my Core Java Course by Naveen Reddy a.k.a. Telusko.

## Day 12

From Today I started to attend a Blog Writing Online assessment program in which I will be taught how to write perfect blogs depending upon the topics from deciding the Blog topics to publishing it online.

## Day 13

Today I made a progress in my Blog writing. Today I learnt how to find a trendy topic for my Niche ( The specific area in which you want to write blog posts is called Niche ). You can have a research on your Niche by using tools like **alltop** and **Google Trends**.

## Day 14

After you had decided the trend on which you want to write blog posts for some time in near future now it is important to create some catchy headlines for your blog post you can have some catchy headlines using these websites for free **TheHoth** and **Hub Spot**.

## Day 15

Now when you are ready with your Catchy Headlines for the blog post let's analyse the headline for the amount of traffic it can gain with that headline. You can use **Coschedule** for this purpose.

## Day 16

After you have written your Blog post I'm sure it will be the best of your content but let's improve it a bit more. You can use **Power Thesaurus** and **Dictionary.com** to Improvise your words to make a better impact on your readers.

## Day 17

After making the nessesary changes in the words of blog we must evaluate our blog with some grammer check tool. You can use **Grammerly** tool to get your grammer check for free with additional suggestions.

## Day 18

Adding Images and gif format videos in your blog post always preferable to make your content more attractable to the reader or the users of the platform either it is your blogging website or some free blogging platfom. You can use **Blogger** for this.

## Day 19

Creating your own image or gif format videos is best as you don't have to search for the image or gif format videos. You can use **Giphy GIF maker** or **ImgFlip**. And for Editing Images you can use **Canva** and **Pixlr**.

## Day 20

Check your plagarism to check the availablity of the content over the internet so that your content don't match up with some other blogs over the internet because it can lead you to get seued for stealing their content. You can use **Dupli Checker** or **Quetext** to get your job done for free.

## Day 21

From today I started building a Mini Project for one of my friend [Apoorva](https://instagram.com/apoorva_vats20) which will be a website similar to [Udemy](https://udemy.com) where everyone will be having access to best books and best video courses over the Internet.

## Day 22

I started designing for the website which can be used for the best UI for the users ( and I think I had my best Designing skills in this ).

## Day 23

I made a bit of Home Page and the Course pages which will help me out to crete the HTML contents via Jinja Templating ( Django related terminology ). It looks good but yes the Dashboard page looks awefull to eyes.

## Day 24

I made a bit of the models and Database Designing and Table seperation from other entries or you can say like creation of tables in Database [ new table for new task ]..

## Day 25

Worked on views like how the URLs will work and how the data will be prsented to the user once the user hit the website with its Unique IP address.

## Day 26

Created some session variables in Python for the website and allotted the users a special user name which will be compared for every particular task and operations will be performed on the basis of the user name which will be stored in session variable.

## Day 27

Worked on some of the images and urls of the books which shall be provided to the user once the user had done with purchasing ( btw I had not made the process for purchasing but working on the file how the user can access the file once logged in ).

## Day 28

After the can can be downloaded I thought of to get rid of the Payment system in this website and now working on it not like I made in [RushX](https://rushx.pythonanywhere.com) but still a decent payment system where you can get the payment done after the owner confirms that you had made the payment yea it is old school but still I love it [ sometimes you can cheat with your customers I know thats illegal but I still dream of this ]
